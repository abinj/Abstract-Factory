# Abstract-Factory
Abstract Factory is a type of design pattern in java

# Applicability
1) A system should be independent of how its products are created, composed and represented
2) A system should be configured with one of multiple families of products
3) A family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint
4) You want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces not thier implementations.
